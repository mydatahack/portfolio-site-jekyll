After reading Nick Cave's Red Hand Files Issue (https://www.theredhandfiles.com/should-we-separate-the-artist-from-the-art/), I started realising that the main reasons why I've been writing songs recently is that I am looking for redemption. I haven't been doing things right lately. I have done a lot of bad things. Through my song writing, I feel like I can redeem myself and rise above it.

There are multiple reasons why I write songs. It really depends on where I am. It is sometimes very superficial. It is sometimes very deep and philosophical.

I asked this questions to a few people. 

Answer from Dom

**I think there may be a whole range of reasons for making art for me, after all I've sort of constructed my life around it. Some are less noble than others perhaps. Maybe I told you that I first resolved to write songs after watching girls screaming at a Hanson concert on TV when I was 13 or 14. I enlisted my older brother to write a song with me and after that I took off on my own. Nowadays, at it's best, I feel it is to get in touch with a very deep and honest part of life or myself, which is also very vulnerable I feel like there is a part of myself which never gets to be expressed, I hold it back maybe, except occasionally in a song. So, it involves my relationship with the universe, with the ocean, the trees and wind and stars. It's a lonely hard reaching out. And when a song gets written or comes through me, a real one (not like something I've forced out with my crafty brain) I  know someone understands at least. Something understands. It is very healing to have that feeling.**

Answer from Richi 1250

**I create art for the pleasure in the process and the satisfaction in the result, and because I appreciate all the art others have made for me to enjoy and I want to contribute to the great pool of art for others to enjoy**

Should we separate the artist from the art?

What is your definition of hope?
CARLOS, RECIFE, BRAZIL
Dear Shelly and Carlos,

I don’t think we can separate the art from the artist, nor should we need to. I think we can look at a piece of art as the transformed or redeemed aspect of an artist, and marvel at the miraculous journey that the work of art has taken to arrive at the better part of the artist’s nature. Perhaps beauty can be measured by the distance it has travelled to come into being.

That bad people make good art is a cause for hope. To be human is to transgress, of that we can be sure, yet we all have the opportunity for redemption, to rise above the more lamentable parts of our nature, to do good in spite of ourselves, to make beauty from the unbeautiful, and to have the courage to present our better selves to the world.

The moon is high and yellow in the sky outside my window. It is a display of sublime beauty. It is also a cry for mercy — that this world is worth saving. Mostly, though, it is a defiant articulation of hope that, despite the state of the world, the moon continues to shine. Hope too resides in a gesture of kindness from one broken individual to another or, indeed, we can find it in a work of art that comes from the hand of a wrongdoer. These expressions of transcendence, of betterment, remind us that there is good in most things, rarely only evil. Once we awaken to this fact, we begin to see goodness everywhere, and this can go some way in setting right the current narrative that humans are shit and the world is fucked. 

Love, Nick
