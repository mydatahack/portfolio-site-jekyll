Because you always find me no matter how flat I become,
Because you stop cars for ducks to safely cross the road,
Because you hold your daughter through the night to provide emotional safety for her to get through the day,
Because your idea of buying a land is to look after animals and grow plants, not to build an apartment complex to make millions,
Because you cannot stand a cigarette butt thrown out in nature,
Because you get angry at drivers who hurt birds on the road,
Because you like my unique voice even if I am singing out of tune,
Because you like me for who I am, not for what I have,
Because you embrace my uniqueness,
Because you are honest and upfront about how you feel,
Because you make me feel it’s OK to be honest and upfront about anything with you,
Because you are happy when I’m happy and having fun and I feel the same for you,
Because your eyes are blue and always true,
Because your hair is like Natalie Portman from V for Vendetta,
Because your heart is joyful, righteous and just,
Because you still believe in love and so do I,
Because you like listening to my story and I love listening to yours,
Because time stretches and light shatters into a rainbow whenever I touch you,
Because you stop and take time to watch birds,
Because you smile the way you do,
Because you like going on adventures and dancing with another weirdo like me,
Because you always kiss me at the right moment,
Because you know I'm not perfect,
Because you are kind to my children and treat them like your own,
Because I can be the best version of myself when I’m around you,
Because I am who I am and you are who you are,

I am madly in love with you.

I would like to keep spending time with you, going on more adventures with you, dancing with you and kissing you at every moment I feel right.

And eventually, If you are crazy enough to fall in love with me, I feel like we can make anything happen and make the world a better place.
