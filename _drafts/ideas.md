# Idea 1

Drunken guy goes to a stripper without realising it. Then while playing pool, he locks his eyes with the girl and the girl sat down and opens her legs and show him pussy. Eventually he realises that he was in the strip club and that's when he knows he went too far.

# Diamond

I sometimes wonder how diamonds get shipped from one place to another. You probably cannot send it with Australia Post. Surely, that's not reliable. How about trusted courier like UPC with their black vans? Nah, probably that's not good enough either. We're talking about diamonds here. They are forever.

Ok, so if someone wants to ship a diamond to someone else, they would hire two men in black suits with sun glasses on. They always work in paris. One of them would carry a suitcase. Inside the suitcase, they have a hole that is a perfect fit for the dyamond they carry. One suitecase per diamond. Then they will take a plain to carry it to the destination. They only use first-class of course.
