We are together -- 
Perfectly imperfect and eternally beautiful --
Just like this world --
We are perpetual motion machines ーー
Of redemption --
Hope is the redemption from hopelessness --
Love from hate --
Joy from pain --
The time we spend together From the time we are part --
From the time we were born till we met --


## Tantric Draft

Song writing is like tantric sex. I stare at my muse for weeks and weeks, no action. Then, suddenly she pulls me and I am in. Bang! When it's done, it's like a whole body orgasm. That is my relationship with my song-writing.

This - is - Tantric --
My relationship with poetry --
I stare at my muse,
Her eyes, her wrist,
Her neck, her lips,
Her hips, her navel,
Her hair, her pubic hair,
Her vagina, her anus,
Her, her, her, she, she, she,
Promised land, Oasis in the desert,
Fucking Cock Lock,
Day after day,
Week after week,
Sometimes month after month,
She's always there,
But, she won't let me touch her --

Blank Page --
The same -- Blank Page --
If I jerk off,
I have to start the ritual from the start again --
I try not to --
But, I sometimes masturbate in -- Secret --
(She know about it, she's just lying beside me, not asleep and feels the movement of my hand),
Ejaculation on the white blank page --
Because she is so hard to get,
Or tantra went too long to be productive --
A new blank page followed by,
Nothing to show for --

Suddenly, out of Nowhere --
Out of the Blue,
Blue Moon Dust,
Full Moon, New Moon,
Blood Moon, Black Moon,
Wet Moon, Super Moon,
Harvest Moon, Hunter Moon,
Wolf Moon, Snow Moon,
Worm Moon, Pink Moon,
Flower Moon, Honey Moon,
Buck Moon, Beaver Moon,
Total Lunar Eclipse,
The dark side of the Moon --
Who know?
She pulls me in,
I am in,
Movements,
Back and forth,
Upward and downward,
Past and Future,
And Right Now,
Right inside the lines,
Outside of the lines,
Between the lines,
In front of the lines,
Behind the lines,
Beyond the lines,
Words, words, words, words, words,
Bang,
Whole body orgasm --

Giving rise to -- This --


## Apocalypse draft

Robocalypse will come --
Are you prepared?

Do not trust computers.

Pens and papers,
Stone walls and chalks,
Leaves and blood,
Dirt on the ground,
Fallen branches from His apple tree,
Sand on the beach,
A piece of wood floated from Afrika,
Where we all came from,
Or the sea shell that she sells by the sea shore --

A Letter in a glass bottle,
With a cork stopper,
Tidal force from the lunatics,
In Mother's breast milk --

A message on a dove's leg,
Sink your teeth into the mycelium network,
For the heavenly neural connections --

Whisper into a paper cup,
Connected to the other paper cup,
By her umbilical cord --

We blamed Her,
But, it was all His fault --
