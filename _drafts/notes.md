##

We are together --
Perfectly imperfect and eternally beautiful --
Just like this world --
We are perpetual motion machines ーー
Of redemption --
Hope is the redemption from hopelessness --
Love from hate --
Joy from pain --
The time we spend together From the time we are part --
From the time we were born till we met --

## Tantric Draft

Song writing is like tantric sex. I stare at my muse for weeks and weeks, no action. Then, suddenly she pulls me and I am in. Bang! When it's done, it's like a whole body orgasm. That is my relationship with my song-writing. Then, I wrote the poem.

## Apocalypse draft

It was an idea of text message exchange with matt. It started with Robocalypse thingie as below and the dropped first 3 lines to make it a bit prettier.

Robocalypse will come --
Are you prepared?

Do not trust computers.

Pens and papers,
Stone walls and chalks,
....

# A body of water draft

As I descended, I saw a body of water below.
There was a log floating on the water.
It was burned black on one end and the other end was cut clean.
I grabbed it on the clean end,
And carefully traced the concentric rings one by one with my finger.

A dirty yellowish brown cloth was floating on the water.
I swam towards the artefact to inspect it,
It was the dead body of a soldier.
My feet touched the sandy bottom and I thought to myself,
the shore is near.

I stood on the land, on the wet sand.
Charcoaled wood pieces, campfire remains,
I walked towards the sand dunes with tiny crabs,
Towards the saltbush shrub before sea level rise and storm surge.
In the twilight of the empire, I saw two red moons in the sky.
