We are together -- 
Perfectly imperfect and eternally beautiful --
Just like this world --
We are perpetual motion machines ーー
Of redemption --
Hope is the redemption from hopelessness --
Love from hate --
Joy from pain --
The time we spend together From the time we are part --
From the time we were born till we met --

## 

Robocalypse will come --
Are you prepared?

Do not trust computers.

Pens and papers,
Stone walls and chalks,
Leaves and blood,
Dirt on the ground,
Fallen branches from His apple tree,
Sand on the beach,
A piece of wood floated from Afrika,
Where we all came from,
Or the sea shell that she sells by the sea shore --

A Letter in a glass bottle,
With a cork stopper,
Tidal force from the lunatics,
In Mother's breast milk --

A message on a dove's leg,
Sink your teeth into the mycelium network,
For the heavenly neural connections --

Whisper into a paper cup,
Connected to the other paper cup,
By her umbilical cord --

We blamed Her,
But, it was all His fault --
