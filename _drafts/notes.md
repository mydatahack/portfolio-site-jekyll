We are together -- 
Perfectly imperfect and eternally beautiful --
Just like this world --
We are perpetual motion machines ーー
Of redemption --
Hope is the redemption from hopelessness --
Love from hate --
Joy from pain --
The time we spend together From the time we are part --
From the time we were born till we met --

## Apocalypse draft

It was an idea of text message exchange with matt. It started with Robocalypse thingie as below and the dropped first 3 lines to make it a bit prettier.

Robocalypse will come --
Are you prepared?

Do not trust computers.

Pens and papers,
Stone walls and chalks,
....
