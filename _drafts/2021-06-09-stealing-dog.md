My brother used to steal dogs from rich people to make money. He would go to a rich suburb like Toorak or South Yarra and steal a dog from a rich-looking house. He kept them in the garage at my mother's place. She's never gone into the garage because she was afraid of Redback spiders. It was kinda funny. She was an intelligent officer for the North Vietnam during the war. She used to camp in Vietnamese rain forest where all kind of crazy tropical creatures live. She was the badass Charlie's angel back in Vietnam. Back in the day, she would have bitten off the head of Readback if they get in her way. Australian suburban life must have mellowed her.

After a few days, missing dog posters would pop up everywhere: ***Lost Dog, my poor pooch, such an angel, with big brown eyes, and fluffy ears etc etc***.
<br /><br />

Then, he would dutifully bring the dog to the right owner. You know nobody really expects to get monetary rewards from returning a missing dog. But, he somehow ended up getting some cash as tokens of gratitude from those rich bastards. There was something special about him that made those rich people want to give him money. It maybe have been because of his mischievous smile or they way he stares at them with his puppy eyes with just the right amount of time. Who knows? He somehow get paid from returning dogs. One time, he got $500 from the old couple who lived in a mansion with gargoyle statues at the gate.
