In Year 12 English class, I had a bet with my friend. If she had a higher score on the exam, I would go to a strip club of my choice and do stripping. If she wins, I would do the same at a male strip club of her choice.
<br /><br />
 
We studied really hard for the exam. When the result came back, our score was equal. This means we both lost and had to do stripping. I accepted the outcome and I would have gone first. Around that time, she started dating with a guy from another class and he didn't really like me. So, she was getting wired about the whole thing. 
<br /><br />

It didn't happen. But, I was so ready for it.
