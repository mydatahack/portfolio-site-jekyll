# Rejection letter idea

The idea is to use these job application letters and modify it for the rejection letter from one night stand.

```

# Idea 1

Drunken guy goes to a stripper without realising it. Then while playing pool, he locks his eyes with the girl and the girl sat down and opens her legs and show him pussy. Eventually he realises that he was in the strip club and that's when he knows he went too far.

# Idea 2

Family party with cocaine and MDMA pills on Christmas Eve.
