# Idea 1

Drunken guy goes to a stripper without realising it. Then while playing pool, he locks his eyes with the girl and the girl sat down and opens her legs and show him pussy. Eventually he realises that he was in the strip club and that's when he knows he went too far.

# Idea 2

My mate's friend's name is Christian. So we call him Buddah. Another one says so if someone's name is mohammad, can we call him Gesus. Then another one says, it's probably not so great. The more close-minded the organisation is, the less it has a sense of humor.

# Idea 3

Family party with cocaine and MDMA pills on Christmas Eve.
