I sometimes wonder how diamonds get shipped from one place to another. We probably cannot send it in a parcel from the post office. Surely, that's not reliable. How about a reputable international courier like UPC with their black vans? Nah, probably that's not good enough either. We're talking about diamonds here. They are forever.
<br /><br />
 
Ok, so if someone wants to ship a diamond to someone else, they would hire two men in black suits with sunglasses on. They would look like Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones from Men in Black. They always work in pairs. One of them carries a suitcase and the other one does the talking. The case is tailor-made. Inside the suitcase, they cut out a hole where the diamond can fit perfectly. One suitcase per diamond. That's right, diamonds must be carried by a person.
<br /><br />
 
They would only use first-class tickets when they fly. When they are on the road, they only use a black limo. It is equipped with a mini bar fridge filled with mini champagne bottles. They are not gonna touch the bottle because they are on duty. What a shame.
<br /><br />
 
They must be carrying guns. Of course.
<br /><br />
 
They have a rendezvous at the destination. It's gotta be at a discreet and private location, like a room at a hotel with no sign. They meet a receiver, open the suitcase and show the gem. Note that the receiver works alone. Always. He carries a suitcase full of cash. He also carries a gun, of course. He opens his to prove that he's got cash. After the confirmation, both parties close the cases and exchange them. During this transaction, nobody utters a word. Just a lot of nods between them.
<br /><br />
 
Yes, that's gotta be the way to mail diamonds.
<br /><br />
 
What about Opals? Ah, Australians are loose. They would probably stuff it in a parcel and mail it with Australian Post.
