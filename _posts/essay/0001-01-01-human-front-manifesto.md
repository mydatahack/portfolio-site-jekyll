- <b>Opening statement</b>
<br /><br />

The Human Front is a military organisation to engage in an imminent space war against hostile aliens. Our primary goal is to prevent the aliens from enslaving our minds and bodies at all costs.
<br /><br />

- <b>Description of the enemy</b>
<br /><br />

We have little knowledge regarding their biology, culture, religions, let alone their military capabilities. However, we must acknowledge that their intentions are solely hostile. Alien sightings have been reported by our comrades all across the globe throughout our history (Figure 1-1). Those aliens belong to the mother ship that is lurking close to the earth orbit (Figure 1-2). We would not yet have technology to observe its presence. However, it is apparent that the destruction of the mother ship leads to the disorganisation and disintegration of the alien species belonging to it. 
<br /><br />

- <b>Strategy</b>
<br /><br />

The game of the pool is the most sophisticated crystallization of human minds (Figure 2-1). We decided to harness its strength to defeat the aliens.
<br /><br />

We must build a giant cue that is as large as Australian continent. We shoot the cue up in the sky to hit the moon. The moon (cue ball) will first hit the Mars (red ball) and pot it into the sun. The moon will bounce off and travel straight to the mother ship. Subsequently, the mother ship will be potted to the black hole (Figure 2-2). The atomisation of the mother ship through the black hole will cause a chain reaction of spontaneous combustions among the rest of aliens.
The necessity of potting the Mars can be explained as an intimidation tactics. Successful potting of the Mars will signal aliens our unity and determination.
<br /><br />

As the source of energy to propel the giant pool cue, we will harness the friction that occurs during masturbation. Friction causes heat and then heat generates energy (Figure 2-3). Human race must stop wasting their energy on masturbation. We must preserve the energy for the imminent launch of the giant cue. We will also build a nuclear power plant around Stephen Hawkins’ penis that is connected to the launch button (Figure 2-4).
<br /><br />

As the replacement of the moon, we will build artificial wave machines in all the major surf beaches across the globe.
<br /><br />

- <b>Human Front Rank system</b>
<br /><br />

As we have declared in the opening statement, our solo purpose is to defend human race from the impending alien attack. The Human Front treats everybody who is willing to sacrifice his life for our cause equally. We do not have ranks. We must refer each other, ‘Comrade’. Each member can call himself whatever he wishes to, as in ‘General’, ‘Major’, ‘Corporal’ and so on if the title boosts the morale and commitment of the individual. However, those titles do not hold any practical purpose for their place in the rank.
<br /><br />

- <b>Membership fee</b>
<br /><br />

$50 dollars of joining fee or a piece of artwork. All the membership fee goes toward the after party. Artworks will be displayed at the after party for those who wish to join the party under the influence of LSD. The Human Front does not believe in banks. The money will be safely concealed at our secret location until our victory.
<br /><br />

- <b>Closing statement</b>
<br /><br />

Since the dawn of the human race, we have been gazing into the darkness of the endless universe and wondered if there would be any other intelligence other than us. Now, an overwhelming amount of evidence suggests that there is a hostile horde of aliens planning to take over our beautiful country. It is high time for human race to recognise the fact and prepare for the war. Our unity and determination only defeat the imminent alien invasion. Human race must unite against aliens.
