I feel like I lost everything that matters to me. Now, every step is a struggle. Every effort seems meaningless.
<br /><br />

But,
<br /><br />

What's around the corner makes it worthwhile for me to keep going -- even though what awaits makes me die in the most horrible way I cannot even imagine. I am hopeful that I may find something amazing once I turn the corner.
<br /><br />

A low dose of optimism is the root of suffering. I am suffering now because I am looking forwards to seeing what is around the corner. I will probably suffer more once I turned the corner. But, there is another corner to turn. I keep going to that corner again. 
<br /><br />

This is an existential hell. Walking down the road is horrible because I do not find any meaning to do so. Even floweres on the sidewalk make me feel sad and lonely. Yet, I still keep going because I have a just enough amount of optimism. I may find some kind of meaning once I turn the corner.
<br /><br />

Yet, every turn is another void. Another tolerable suffering.
<br /><br />
