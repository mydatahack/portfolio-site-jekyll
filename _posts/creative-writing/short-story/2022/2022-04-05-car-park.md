While I was snorting coke in the toilet cubicle with Sam, Nick was having a telephone sex in the car park at Eureka community center. It was intermittently drizzling and the air was already cold. The daylight saving was gonna end tomorrow. It was the first Saturday of April. Quang told us that the reason why we use the word dozen for a collection of 12 things was that we used to have twelve fingers. We lost them somehow along the way. The humans collectively decided to forget about them. I had to keep going. There was so much booze and I was so far from home.
