When I went to Japan last time, I got arrested and spent 2 weeks in jail.
<br /><br />

I was making graffiti in Shibuya and two police officers came. I was using red spray paint and got literally caught red-handed. I got arrested and put in a detention center. Someone from the Australian embassy visited me in a jail. I was told I have to spend the minimum of 3 months and the maximum of 8 years if I get charged. I was stressed. It would suck to spend that much time in jail.
<br /><br />

I was sharing a cell with 2 people, the old and young. The old guy was arrested for tax fraud. He didn't speak much English at all. He had a photo of his Lamborghini. He looked at the photo all the time. The young one spoke English. He got arrested for robbing a liquor store.
<br /><br />

Food was good there. We had miso soup every meal.
<br /><br />

I didn't get charged. I was released after 2 weeks. That was how I got caught red-handed in Japan.
