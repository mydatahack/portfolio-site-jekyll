I snorted a line of coke and dropped a few shroom caps before going to the Slow Grind at the Loop Bar in the city. It was Jane's birthday and she wanted to dance all night. As I was dancing on the floor to Richie 1250's sleazy 80's slow dance tunes, a fat girl dropped a tab of acid in my mouth. Jane had a bag of MD and let me have some. I took the bag and headed for the male toilet. Her female friend whose name I never found out followed me into the toilet cubicle. As I was scooping the powder with my key, she took off her pants and started peeing in front of me. 'I hope you're not feeling uncomfortable. I just need to pee.'

Every now and then, I think about her beautiful shaven vagina and masturbate.
