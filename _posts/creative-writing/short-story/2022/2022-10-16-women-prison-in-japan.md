When I was living in Japan, my job required me to visit women's prisons. I worked as a salesman for a company that sells correspondence vocational education packages.
<br /><br />

Women prisons in Japan are run only by women. Even the prison guards are women. Female prisoners are deprived of men.
<br /><br />

Apparently, there are always a few prisoners who start taking off their clothes whenever they see a man. No matter how ugly he is, it really doesn't matter. They get so excited about the presence of opposite sex. Taking off their clothes results in a punishment. They have to spend a period of time in an isolation room. They don't care. They risk it anyway.
<br /><br />

When I visited a jail for the first time, a young woman prisoner took off her clothes as I was walking by her cell. She put her right fist up in her vagina. Before the prison guard had time to get in her cell and beat her up, she managed to have an intense shaking orgasm.
<br /><br />

After that incident, she completed training to be an aged carer before she was released. I think of her whenever I see an aged care center.
