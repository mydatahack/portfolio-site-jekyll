Pole jumping, also known as pole vaulting, is a competitive sport where the athletes compete against each other on how high they can jump by using a long flexible stick.
<br /><br />

The origin of pole jumping goes way back before humans invented a bridge. Our ancestors used a long stick made out of a tree to boost themselves to jump over rivers. It was an essential survival skill.
<br /><br />

We had to to stop them from crossing the river. They hate water. After all the bridges were destroyed, the only method for us to cross rivers is to use a long flexible stick. You run towards the bank, stick it on the ground, and propel yourself to the other side, just like a pole jumper.
<br /><br />

We have gone back to the way of our ancestors.
