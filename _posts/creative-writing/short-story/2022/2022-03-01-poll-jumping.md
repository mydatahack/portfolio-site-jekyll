Pole jumping, also known as pole vaulting, is a competitive sport where the athletes compete against each other on how high they can jump by using a long flexible stick.
<br /><br />

The origin of pole jumping goes way back before humans invented a bridge. Our ancestors used a long stick made out of a tree to boost themselves to jump over rivers. It was an essential survival skill to use a stick to jump far over the river.
<br /><br />

When Z Day happens, all the bridges will be destroyed. We must do it to stop them from crossing the river. They hate water. The only means for us to cross rivers is to use a long flexible stick. You run towards the bank, stick it on the ground, and propel yourself to the other side, just like a pole jumper.
<br /><br />

Pole jumping circles back to where it came from. We are going back to where we came from, crossing rivers by a long flexible stick.
