When I was living in Japan, my job required me to visit women's prisons. I worked as a salesman for a company that sells correspondence vocational education.
<br /><br />

Women's prisons in Japan are run only by women. Even the prison guards are women. Female prisoners are deprived of men.
<br /><br />

Apparently, there are always a few prisoners who start taking off their clothes whenever they see a man. No matter how ugly he is, it really doesn't matter. They get so excited about the mere presence of opposite-sex. Taking off their clothes results in a punishment. They have to spend a period of time in an isolation room without any window. They don't care. They risk it anyway. In the moment of madness, the animal instinct kicks in.
<br /><br />

When I visited a jail for the first time, a young woman prisoner took off her clothes as I was walking by her cell. She put her right fist up in her vagina. Before the prison guard had time to get in her cell and beat her up, she managed to have an intense shaking orgasm.
<br /><br />

After the incident, she was sent to an isolation cell for 14 days. She eventually completed training to be an aged carer before she was released. I think of her whenever I see an aged care center.
