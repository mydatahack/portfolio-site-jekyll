'We live in a society where it is normal for a father to visit his kids for a few hours per fortnight. For that privilege, he pays so much money.' Joe said.
<br /><br />
 
'In this culture, women do not need to have men to have a family. For men to have a family, we need commitment from women. Men need women to have a family. When a wife decides to withdraw her commitment from a husband to have a family, he loses it. A man in this culture is disposable. We are walking and talking ATM machine for them.
<br /><br />
 
The society ignores male emotional pain. The family law system and our legal system consciously denies male pain in Australia. When you go to the family court, it does not even care about the father's pain for not being able to see children. Most of them sacrificed themselves in the labour market and fought with their skills and competency. They worked hard for the family. Women see it as oppression and leave him for what, working hard for the family. They are encouraged to do anything to fulfill themselves to make it happy.
<br /><br />
 
The system is really set up for a single mother to thrive. It encourages women to break up marriage. The nuclear family to succeed is greatly reduced because of the State.
<br /><br />
 
Marriage game is rigged. It only becomes clearer when the separation happens.
<br /><br />
 
The university teaches that women are victims. Men are oppressive. Society tells them that male drive to succeed is tyranny.'
<br /><br />
 
'I see. I understand your pain, man.' I said.
<br /><br />
 
'But, you know what, it's much simpler than that. She left you because you were an arsehole. Don't intellectualise it. A woman needs a man. I have faith. There is a woman out there who needs me.'
