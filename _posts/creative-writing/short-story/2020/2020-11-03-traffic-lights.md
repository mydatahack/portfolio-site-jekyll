I've been a really good mate with Davo for a long time. Probably since just after I left school. We were the same age and hung out a lot. When we were about 30, I found out he had colour blindness. I had no idea. How would I have not known he had such a condition. There perhaps had not been the need for him to tell me. It somehow came up in the conversation and I got to know it. 'Man, how do you read traffic lights?' I asked. 'Ah, that's why traffic lights are lined up and I know when to go by the position.' he said.
<br /><br />

When I was in Doha for a holiday, I saw the crazy traffic lights. There are 6 of the lights and arrows everywhere around them. I took a photo of it and later asked him how he would figure out what to do with it.
<br /><br />

'Just go straight, mate' he said.
