My dad parked his car in the disabled parking spot. There were two parking inspectors, checking the cars. He grabbed a torn piece of Carlton slab box, rolled it up and inserted it into the bottom opening of the jeans on the left. He slowly got out of the car and limped toward the officers. He banged the shin of his left leg with his fist a few times. It made the noise of fist hitting a cardboard box. He smiled at the officers. 'I parked there. It's fake, mate. I hope it's alright.'
<br /><br />

That was the lengths that he would go to in order to con people.
