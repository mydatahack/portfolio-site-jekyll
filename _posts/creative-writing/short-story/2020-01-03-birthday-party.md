Before I started playing in the Garbage Collection, I was doing a PhD in Genetics. I was at some birthday party in a hip pub in Richmond. I tried to drink as much free booze as I can while the bar tab lasted. I think I’ve drunk 70% of the tab all by myself. Free drink was a rare delight in those days. This was way before the life of sex, drug and Rock’ n’ Roll. I’m wearing a cream-coloured leather jacket from an Opshop in Brighton and a pair of vintage black-framed glasses, going for nerd chic. These people are my fellow science nerd friends who’d get my esoteric DNA jokes. I was preaching the benefit of LSD for science. After all, the legend tells that Francis Crick was walking on the beach on acid when he came up with the double helix structure.

Not long after the photo was taken, the guy next to me, Brenton, hijacked the DJ booth with his iPod and played Thriller so that he can show everyone his break-dance skills. The night went wilder and wilder. We went onto a club in the city later. I picked up a really cute brunette girl at the club and made her climb an abandoned cillo in Collingwood to watch the sunrise with me. We’ve spent all day in her bed.

I never called her back.
