Me and my best mate, Jonesy, had a big night in the city. We started drinking at 2pm in the afternoon. It was a Friday. We knocked off work early and went to a pub. We kept drinking into the night.
<br /><br />

After many pints of beer and tequila shots, the bartender did the last call. The pub was closing. We decided to go to another pub. 
<br /><br />

So, we went into a pub nearby. We walked in, saw a pool table, and started playing pool. Then, I saw a brunette girl in a black dress walking towards me. We made eye contact and I immediately felt the spark. It was one of those moments that you just knew she was up for it.
<br /><br />

She sat on the chair by the pool table, just opposite to where I stood. She pulled up her skirt, opened her legs and started touching herself.
<br /><br />

I was thinking to myself: 'Wow wow wow, how this could be happening! I just hit the jackpot! She's hot and crazy!'
<br /><br />

Then, I suddenly realised that we were in a strip club. When we got in the club, both of us were too drunk to even realise it was a strip club. That was when I knew we went too far.
