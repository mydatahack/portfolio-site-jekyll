My brother used to steal dogs from rich people to make money. He went to rich suburbs like Toorak or South Yarra and stole dogs from rich-looking houses. He kept them in the garage at our mother's place. Back then, we were still living with her. She's went into the garage because she was afraid of spiders.
<br /><br />

He had the whole operation set up in the garage. He had dog cages stacked up like an apartment complex. He basically built a bloody dog shelter in the garage.
<br /><br />

After a few days, missing dog posters would usually pop up everywhere: _Lost Dog, my poor pooch, such an angel, with big brown eyes, and fluffy ears etc etc_.
<br /><br />

Then, he would dutifully bring the dog to the right owner. OK, nobody really expects to get cash rewards from returning a missing dog. For some crazy reasons, he always ended up getting paid. There was something special about him that made the rich people want to give him money. Was it because of his mischievous smile? Was it because of the way he stares at them with his puppy eyes with just the right length of time. Who knows? He somehow made money from returning dogs.
<br /><br />

All good things must come to an end.
<br /><br />

He stole a female pooch from an expensive-looking house in St Kilda. One of those houses with gargoyle status at the gate. She was a Pom, a fluffy little one. He didn't know who the owner was. It didn't matter. He took her back to the garage, his own private hack dog shelter. He waited for the missing dog posters to appear.
<br /><br />

It never came. After a week, he went back to the house to check on the owner.
<br /><br />

There was no house. It wasn't there. He swore he went back to the right location. It was an empty land. Weeds growing everywhere. The gargoyles were still there at the gate. There was no mistake. The house was there where he stole the fluffy pooch.
<br /><br />

He went back to the garage where he kept the dog. To his surprise, she wasn't there. He stared at the empty cage. She vanished into thin air just like the house. He swore she was there just before he left. He asked his mother if she had seen a dog that fit the description he gave her. Her answer was no.
<br /><br />

The whole thing completely spooked him out. After that, he never stole a dog from rich people to make money.
