Jin said, 'I have no plan for the next 10 years. No plan at all.' on his 40's birthday. What a beautiful sentiment it is. I'm turning 40 next year. I hope to say the same thing. As we get older, we know more about the place we were in this world. We fine-tune what we want out of our life. We worry less about what we don't have. We care less about the society of expectations. I've been worrying about those things all my life and didn't end up achieving any of them. I'm still single. I am a migrant and do not have family in this country. I am lonely. I still live in a rental property. I don't have any savings. I have a shit job. It doesn't matter. If I could accept who I am and snatch the joy out of this crap thing called life, I don't need to have a plan. I can be myself and keep going forwards on my own train.

You know what, Jin went home with a beautiful 26 years old brunette that night. He wasn't even trying. She was literally throwing herself at him. I was thinking to myself, 'Fuck, how does that happen?'. After all, it was his birthday. A birthday boy needs to get laid no matter how old he is. It's a law of physics that the universe installed for all of us.
