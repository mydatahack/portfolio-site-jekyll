Dear Taka,
<br /><br />

I appreciate the time you took to come in for the physical performance trial for my mating partner position the other night. You were not selected to return to my apartment. I have already received applications from many qualified candidates, several of whom are taller, better-looking, and more masculine, having bigger cars, balls, and penises and greater earning capabilities, key job requirements.
<br /><br />

Thank you for participating in the trial with me. I enjoyed meeting you and appreciate your interest in applying for my opening position. I also appreciate the time you invested in foreplay although I feel that you could have spent a little longer and made a little bit more effort.
<br /><br />

I wish you success in your ongoing mating partner search. Please do not consider re-applying for the position for which you are assessed as 'not adequately qualified'. It will be a waste of time for both of us.
<br /><br />

Sincerely,
<br /><br />
Betty
