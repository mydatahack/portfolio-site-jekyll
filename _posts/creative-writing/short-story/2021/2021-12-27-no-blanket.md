The urban legend is true. If you keep feeding a cat, they get as big as a lion. I've fed Lola grass fed wagyu steak for six months straight. She got as big as a female lion that I saw at Werribee Open Range Zoo. She still chased mice and killed native birds every once in a while. She still loved to get her chin stroked and slept on my bed. I no longer needed a blanket.
