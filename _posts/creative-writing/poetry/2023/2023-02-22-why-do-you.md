Why do you keep reading to me --

Let me keep your house key --

Send me flowers --

Keep the water fresh --

In the vase that houses the aforementioned flowers?
<br /><br />

Why do you keep bringing the eggs --

From the chicken in your garden --

And Fish that you caught --

With the worms --

From the aforementioned garden?
<br /><br />

Why do you keep telling me --

Your daughter cut the potatoes --

The way I taught her --

Keep bringing me the potatoes --

You cut in the aforementioned way?
<br /><br />

Why do you keep coming to my house --

Keep borrowing books from my bookshelf --

Pruning the shrubs in my field --

Water my vegetable plants --

Grow in the aforementioned field?
<br /><br />
