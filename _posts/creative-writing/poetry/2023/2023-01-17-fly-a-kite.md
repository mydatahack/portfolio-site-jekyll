Fly a kite into the storm of my sorrow,

It will shred it into a million pieces.
<br /><br />
Sail through the flood of my rage,

Nobody will survive.
<br /><br />
Walk across the desert of my loneliness,

There is no oasis.
<br /><br />
Sleigh into the blizzard of my jealousy,

You will lose your digits.
<br /><br />
Throw a rock into the ocean of my love,

It will sink forever,

Into the bottomless bottom,

A pit of darkness,

No way to float back up,

Until getting through,

To the other side.
<br /><br />
