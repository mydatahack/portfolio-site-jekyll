I fired a nail gun

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into Emma's right breast
<br /><br />

click, click, click, click, click
<br /><br />

She blead and cried
<br /><br />

I held her in my arms
and gently pulled all the nails.
<br /><br />

I sincerely apologized to her
-- I am sorry. I didn't mean to hurg you
<br /><br />

She said -- it's ok, I will forgive you
<br /><br />

The holes left by the nails on her breast

remained opened and hollow

Everytime she looks at her breast

She was reminded

that I was the one who

fired the nail gun at her

perfect breast
