A moment of madness

I'm waiting for you --

No consequence -- No future --

I'll embrace you with my arms wide open

with clarity -- purpose -- deamon -- angel 

of a martyr

strapped in a ticking time bomb

at the Federation Square 3pm --

Sunny Sunday afternoon
<br /><br />

A moment of maddness

Come to me -- Come to me --

Reasoning will be a retrospective spectacle

Contemplated in a gap between your baby and womb

where I have no part to play

I'm tired of --

justifying my will with a perfect will --

There is no such will anyway
<br /><br />

A moment of maddness

Free me -- Free me --

Defy the law of gravity

the power of reasoning --

A healthy dose of hope --

Cold stare of the 3-eyed skull

with 20-20-20 vision

My dope, doctor, dog, dough, doctorin

documentation, Dostoevsky

Burn them all
