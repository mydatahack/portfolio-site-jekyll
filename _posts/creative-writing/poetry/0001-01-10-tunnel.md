&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I dragged my feet into the dark tunnel. There was neither day nor night. There was no light. I simply lost my sight. Not a single speck of star beamed a ray of hope. Not a single drop of rain redeemed my dry soul.
<br /><br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summer, it burned red-hot coals like the industrial garbage furnace. In winter, it froze everything, even my bones. Neither spring nor autumn ever came. There was neither the joy of being born nor the calamity of the last dying day.
<br /><br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I stopped writing poems in the tunnel of darkness. I’ve burned my words in summer. I froze and shattered them in winter. I would find neither a single dime nor rhyme in my pocket. I didn’t think I deserved either one of them, anyway.
