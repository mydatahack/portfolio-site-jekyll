&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I dragged my feet into the dark tunnel. There was neither day nor night. There was no light. So, I simply lost my sight. Not a single speck of stars beamed a ray of hope. Not a single drop of rain redeemed my dried out soul.
<br /><br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summer, it was like the industrial garbage furnace burning red-hot coals. In winter it froze everything, even my bones. Neither spring nor autumn ever came. There was neither the joy of being born nor the calamity of the last dying days.
<br /><br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I stopped writing poems in the tunnel of darkness. I’ve burned my words in summer. I froze and shattered them in winter. I would find neither a single dime nor rhyme in my pocket. I didn’t think I deserved either one of them, anyway.
