This - is - Tantric --

My relationship with poetry --

I stare at my muse,

Her eyes, her wrist,

Her neck, her lips,

Her hips, her navel,

Her hair, her pubic hair,

Her vagina, her anus,

Her, her, her, she, she, she,

Promised land, Oasis in the desert,

Fucking Cock Lock,

Nipple Clamps,

Day after day,

Week after week,

Sometimes month after month,

She's always there,

But, she won't let me touch her --
<br /><br />

Blank Page --

The same -- Blank Page --

If I jerk off,

I have to start the ritual from the start again --

I try not to --

But, I sometimes masturbate in -- Secret --

(She know about it, she's just lying beside me, not asleep and feels the movement of my hand, but she won't say a word),

Ejaculation on the white blank page --

Because she is so hard to get,

Or tantra went too long to be productive --

A new blank page followed by,

Nothing to show for --
<br /><br />

Suddenly, out of Nowhere --

Out of the Blue,

Blue Moon Dust,

Full Moon, New Moon,

Blood Moon, Black Moon,

Wet Moon, Super Moon,

Harvest Moon, Hunter Moon,

Wolf Moon, Snow Moon,

Worm Moon, Pink Moon,

Flower Moon, Honey Moon,

Buck Moon, Beaver Moon,

Total Lunar Eclipse,

The dark side of the Moon --

Who knows?

She pulls me in,

I am in,

Movements,

Back and forth,

Upward and downward,

Past and Future,

And Right Now,

Right inside the lines,

Outside of the lines,

Between the lines,

In front of the lines,

Behind the lines,

Beyond the lines,

Words, words, words, words, words...

Bang,

Whole body orgasm --
<br /><br />

Giving rise to -- This --
<br /><br />
