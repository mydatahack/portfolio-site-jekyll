Pens and papers

Stone walls and chalks,

Leaves and blood,

Dirt on the ground,

Fallen branches from His apple tree,

Sand on the beach,

A piece of wood floated from Afrika,

Where we all came from,

Or the sea shell that she sells by the sea shore --
<br /><br />

A Letter in a glass bottle,

With a cork stopper,

Tidal force from the lunatics,

In Mother's breast milk --
<br /><br />

A message on a dove's leg,

Sink your teeth into the mycelium network,

For the heavenly neural connections --
<br /><br />

Whisper into a paper cup,

Connected to the other paper cup,

By Her umbilical cord --
<br /><br />

We blamed Her,

But, it was all His fault --
<br /><br />
