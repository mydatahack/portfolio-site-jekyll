As I descended, I saw a body of water below.

There was a log floating on the water.

It was burned black on one end and the other end was cut clean.

I grabbed it on the clean end,

And carefully traced the concentric rings one by one with my finger.
<br /><br />

A dirty yellowish brown cloth was floating on the water.

I swam towards the artefact to inspect it,

It was the dead body of a soldier.

My feet touched the sandy bottom and I thought to myself,

the shore is near.
<br /><br />

I stood on the land, on the wet sand.

Charcoaled wood pieces, campfire remains,

I walked towards the sand dunes with tiny crabs,

Towards the saltbush shrub before sea level rise and storm surge.

In the twilight of the empire, I saw two red moons in the sky.
<br /><br />
