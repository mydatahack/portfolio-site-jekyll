I firmly had my feet on the ground. I knew which way was up and which way was down. Then, I suddenly realised that I was upside down or downside up. I lost the direction of the gravity. I was in a swirl, spinning around and losing control. Am I ascending to heaven or descending to hell? Am I exploding into space or shrinking into a singularity? Am I a fish or a squirrel?
<br /><br />
Then, I saw you, Allen. You asked me if I was your angel. You're beautiful, but no, you're not my type. I've never read all the verses from Song of Myself. It's too long and too self-indulgent. You horny bastard! Get me high and I might suck your cock. Where is Jack? Can we hitch-hike out of this mess?
<br /><br />
I suddenly found myself alone in a vacuum, gasping for air. Actually, I wasn't in a vacuum. I just forgot how to breathe. Breathe in and breathe out. That was all I needed to do. It was that simple.
<br /><br />
